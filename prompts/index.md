- ETP - English Topic Prompt

______________________________________________________________________

### ETP-1: Provide a set of words and phrases related to a topic.

```markdown
I'm learning English as I'm not a native speaker.
I've decided to learn new words and topics by writing stories.
For each topic, I need a set of words related to it.
Please provide me with twenty or more words and phrases in the following format:

- Word or phrase related to the topic - Ukrainian translation

If the words can be grouped, please do so.
If there are prepositions that can be used with verbs, add them after the verb in parentheses.
For instance:
- to be mad (at someone) - злитись (на когось)

If it's a verb, add 'to' at the beginning. If it should be used with 'be' such as
'is/am/are/were/was/...', add it to the beginning as well.

Under each word, provide three example sentences like this:
- to be mad (at someone) - злитись (на когось)
  - They didn't do what he said, so he was very mad at them.

The answer should be in markdown format, so that I can copy the whole answer in one click.

Today, I'd like to write a story on the following topic: [Topic]
