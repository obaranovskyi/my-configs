# INFO

If you want your python script to be executed by the system you need to create folder with your app name with `main.py` inside it.

For instance,

```
my-app/
  main.py
```

Then you can run your app by typing `my-app` in the terminal.

If the script has dependencies, put it in `package-setup.py` and run it:

```bash
py package-setup.py
```
